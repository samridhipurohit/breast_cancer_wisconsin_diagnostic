## Data  

The dataset used for this project is the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic)** dataset from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository] 
(https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)).

It contains **measurements of cell nuclei** from digitized images of fine-needle aspirates of breast masses.  
Each observation corresponds to one patient, with features describing the shape, texture and size of the cell nuclei.

- **File:** `data/breast_cancer_wisconsin.csv`  
- **Observations:** 569 patients  
- **Variables:** 30 numeric features + diagnosis (`M` = malignant, `B` = benign)

This CSV file was created from the original UCI files (`wdbc.data` and `wdbc.names`) to include clear column headers and ensure compatibility with R scripts.  
Only the cleaned, labeled version (`breast_cancer_wisconsin.csv`) is used in this analysis.
